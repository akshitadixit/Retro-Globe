# Retro-Globe

Hi there, this is just a super random THREE.js website I made for my grandma who discovered what a website is for the first time in her life and asked me if I could make something including her favorite songs. Made over a period of 48 hours, she really likes it. I'm not a web developer but working on this brought me so much happiness, it is wholesome :) Definitely not something I would call a project, nor put up on my resume, but you should have heard the excitement in her voice and the childish curiousity she had for this spinning 3d globe with her favorite actors. Stay safe and healthy everyone, thanks for reading the story.

Oh and in case you want to try this out, visit the link in the about section and tap on the actors to play their famous songs.
